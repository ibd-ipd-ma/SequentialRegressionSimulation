# Sequential Regression and Simulation

This repository provides code used in our paper "A method for estimating causal effects from heterogeneous clinical trials without a common control group using sequential regression and simulation: an individual participant data meta-analysis and validation study".

It includes files used to aggregate and harmonize individual participant data from 9 randomized controlled trials (Data Preparation), and files used for a meta-analysis (Modeling Process).
